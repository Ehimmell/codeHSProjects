# codeHSProjects
Old (Like, really old) projects I built on the sandbox of an educational coding website, CodeHS. 

A lot of this is just stuff I want to remember, as it was built using codeHS's libraries and IDE that I have no access to anymore.

Some cool projects include:

A graphing calculator

A scroller game

An algorithm that factors a given equation (e.g. x^2 - 1 to (x-1)(x+1)

An Akinator-like algorithm that uses questions to determine the user's character out of the various characters in an array (Very advanced, I know) that uses a sort-of neural network concept
